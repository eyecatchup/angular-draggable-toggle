## Credits

This project is based on [Simon Tabor's jQuery Toggles](https://github.com/simontabor/jquery-toggles). I just fixed some minor bugs, added support for touch-enabled devices, replaced the Makefile with Gulp and, of course, created the Angular wrapper. Anyways, all probs should go to Simon!
